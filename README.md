This is a Product Search Tool with a hard coded JSON feed.

## To use it:
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/dysonpro/ProductSearch`
- run `npm install` (this takes a while)
- run `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (It should load automatically)

```
git clone https://github.com/dysonpro/ProductSearch
npm install
npm start
```


## Comments on how it works:
- Created with Create React App
- No Ajax request to fetch JSON (the server would need to be configured to serve the file)
- No Polyfills were added for Internet Explorer (So IE doesn't work yet)
- Some other items not yet completed (containers, types, default props, unit tests, etc.)
